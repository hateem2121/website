## 2026-07-13 — Session 1 (cont.) · 🟢 LIVE on workers.dev + first admin created (Phase-0 gate item 1 ✅)

**Milestone:** the app is **deployed and reachable** at `https://run-apparel.hateemjamshaid.workers.dev` and Hateem **created the first admin** at `/admin` successfully. That confirms the whole path works end-to-end: Cloudflare Workers Build → deployed Worker → native D1 binding (schema I pre-applied) → Payload wrote the admin account. **Phase-0 §17 gate item 1 (deployed starter reachable) is met.**
- Deploy mechanism: Cloudflare Workers Builds on `main`; build command `corepack enable && pnpm install && pnpm exec opennextjs-cloudflare build`; deploy `npx wrangler deploy`. `PAYLOAD_SECRET` set by Hateem as an encrypted Worker secret.
- Automated WebFetch to the URL returns 403 (Cloudflare bot-block on non-browser requests) — expected; the site works in a browser.
- **Single branch:** only `main` exists (local + remote); the old session branch is gone. Future work commits directly to `main` (Hateem's standing instruction + CLAUDE.md §8).

**Still open for Phase-0 gate (spec §17 row 0):**
- **§15 smoke test (gate item 2)** — NOT yet run against production. Needs the Cloudflare connector (D1 query) to verify. Scope now: for `users` + `media`, create→read→update→**delete→re-query to confirm the delete persisted**; media upload → object in R2 `run-assets` → delete → confirm gone; admin login already ✓. (Buyer-signup emails + full RFQ round-trip = §15 items 3–4, deferred to Phases 5–6.)
- **Nightly backup Action (gate item 3, chunk G1–G3)** — `backup.yml` (`wrangler d1 export` → `run-private/backups/`, 30-day retention). Needs a scoped `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in **GitHub Actions encrypted secrets** (the one secure home for a token; the Claude env has no secret store).
- **Runbook** `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (chunk G4): Time Travel, billing thresholds, DMARC ramp, smoke-test log.
- **Observability** (D3): confirm Workers Logs observability is on (default).
- **Billing/usage notifications** (F4) + **Bot Fight Mode / rate-limit / Cloudflare Access on /admin** (F1–F3) — Hateem dashboard actions.
- **Email (Stage E)** — Resend + DNS; only needed for Phase 5 really, but the Phase-0 plan lists it. Hostinger already runs catch-all → hateem@; wear-run.com DNS is at Hostinger, wear-run.help at Cloudflare. Cloudflare Email Routing NOT used (would break Hostinger catch-all).
- **Deferred / parked:** `assets.wear-run.com` R2 custom domain (needs the domain on Cloudflare; it's on Hostinger — decide move-to-CF vs use `assets.wear-run.help`); CLAUDE.md §2 `docs/spec/` path amendment (awaiting Hateem); RFQ Plan §16 regenerated-content review (before Phase 2/5).

**Note for the next session:** the Cloudflare Developer Platform connector kept toggling to `enabledInChat: false` in this chat, blocking verification — hence continuing in a fresh chat. **First thing next session: confirm the Cloudflare connector is enabled for the chat, then run the §15 smoke test.**

## 2026-07-13 — Session 1 (cont.) · First-deploy build fixes (Workers Builds)

**What was done (all verified by reproducing the CI build locally before pushing):**
- **Workers Builds first attempt** failed at `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` ("could not determine executable") — CI hadn't installed deps / detect the package manager. Fixed: added `packageManager: pnpm@10.33.0`, `.node-version` (22), lowered `engines.node` floor, and set the CI build command to `corepack enable && pnpm install && pnpm exec opennextjs-cloudflare build`.
- **Second attempt** got all the way through `next build` (compile + typecheck + static gen ✓) and failed in OpenNext bundling: `Could not resolve "drizzle-kit-8c53b399dac79e94/api"` (payloadcms/payload#16470). Root cause: `@payloadcms/drizzle`'s `requireDrizzleKit()` does a static `require('drizzle-kit/api')` (migration tooling, never called at runtime); Turbopack externalizes it to a hashed name the OpenNext esbuild pass can't resolve.
  - Tried `serverExternalPackages: ['drizzle-kit']` and installing drizzle-kit as a direct dep — **neither fixed it** (the hashed reference still failed).
  - **Fix (committed):** a `pnpm patch` on `@payloadcms/drizzle@3.86.0` rewrites the static `require('drizzle-kit/api')` to a computed specifier `require(['drizzle-kit','api'].join('/'))` in both the sqlite and postgres `requireDrizzleKit.js`, so the bundler can't statically trace it. Patch file: `patches/@payloadcms__drizzle@3.86.0.patch`, wired via `pnpm.patchedDependencies`. Kept `drizzle-kit` as a direct devDep so `payload migrate:create` still works for generating future schema.
  - **Verified:** clean `pnpm exec opennextjs-cloudflare build` → `Worker saved in .open-next/worker.js`, exit 0.
- All on `main`. Next: Hateem re-runs the Workers Builds deployment (build will now pass → `wrangler deploy` publishes) → then first admin + §15 smoke test.

## 2026-07-13 — Session 1 (cont.) · Readiness confirmed; access approach being revised for security

**Confirmed by Hateem (facts):**
- Workers Paid = **ACTIVE** ✅ · card on file ✅ · Hostinger hPanel admin ✅.
- **DNS locations (important — reverse of the spec's §3.5 assumption):** `wear-run.com` DNS is on **Hostinger**; `wear-run.help` DNS is on **Cloudflare**.

**Security course-correction (supersedes how decision #2 gets executed):**
- The Claude Code web environment exposes only a **plaintext, visible "Environment variables" box** ("visible to anyone… don't add secrets or credentials") + a setup script. There is **no secure secret store** shown there → a Cloudflare API token must **not** go in it (CLAUDE.md §11, spec §3.7). Awaiting Hateem: does a separate encrypted "Secrets" section exist?
- **I have no Hostinger or Cloudflare MCP connector** (available connectors: GitHub, Apollo, Google Drive/Calendar, Twilio, Claude_Code_Remote). Hateem believed I was "connected via MCP" to both domains — I am not. So I cannot reach either domain's DNS or his Cloudflare account directly.
- **Revised access model (pending Hateem's OK, contradicts recorded decision #2):** Hateem performs Cloudflare/Hostinger dashboard steps via exact click-paths; the one API token needed (nightly backup) lives in **GitHub Actions encrypted secrets**, not the Claude env. Deploy is Workers Builds (no token in our env). If a real Secrets store exists, a token there could let Claude automate more.

**Parked (non-blocking):** `assets.wear-run.com` (R2 public custom domain, spec §3.4) needs the domain on Cloudflare, but wear-run.com is on Hostinger → either move it to Cloudflare later, or use `assets.wear-run.help` (already on Cloudflare). Not a Phase-0 gate item (site runs on workers.dev until Phase 8).

**RESOLVED same day — Cloudflare connector + chunks C1/C2 done:**
- Hateem connected the **Cloudflare Developer Platform connector** (OAuth) → secure access, no token in the visible box. The env-secret question is now moot for Cloudflare resource work. (Backups will still need a CF API token in **GitHub Actions** encrypted secrets — chunk G2.)
- **C1 done:** D1 `run-apparel-db` created — id `39ac4f94-0ee3-437b-849f-20b00c34b7c3`, region ENAM, read-replication disabled (per spec §2, enable only when traffic warrants). `database_id` wired into `wrangler.jsonc`.
- **C2 done:** R2 buckets `run-assets` (public assets) + `run-private` (never public) created, region ENAM. `run-assets` bound as `R2` for Payload media; `run-private` binding added in Phase 5 (uploads).
- **D1-layer smoke pre-check PASSED** via connector query on run-apparel-db: create → read (`{id:1,val:'created'}`) → update (`val:'updated'`) → delete → re-query (`remaining:0`, delete persisted) → dropped temp table. Guards the Dec-2025 D1 silent-DELETE bug (payload#15070) at the SQL layer. **Full §15 smoke test (Payload collections + media + auth) still to run after first deploy.**
- **Connector limits (still need Hateem's dashboard):** Worker **deploy** (via Workers Builds — chunk D1), **DNS/email** records (Hostinger for wear-run.com; Cloudflare for wear-run.help), the `PAYLOAD_SECRET` secret, and protections (Bot Fight/rate-limit/Access/billing). The connector exposes D1, R2, Workers list/get, and D1 query only.
- **C3 DONE (schema pre-applied to real D1):** rather than rely on a fragile build-time `payload migrate` (which needs authenticated remote access in CI), applied the template's initial migration (`20250929_111647`) DDL directly to run-apparel-db via the connector — 8 Payload tables + indexes created, and the migration recorded in `payload_migrations` (batch 1). Verified via `sqlite_master`. So the deployed Worker connects to a ready schema; **no migrate step in the deploy**.
- **Deploy design (chunk D):** keep `remote: false` (build uses local mock, needs no creds; deployed Worker uses native D1/R2 bindings at runtime via `getCloudflareContext` — the `remote` flag never affects runtime). Workers Builds config: build command `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`, deploy command `npx wrangler deploy` (default). `PAYLOAD_SECRET` set by Hateem as an encrypted Worker secret (kept out of repo/chat/logs per CLAUDE.md §11). Connector cannot deploy Workers, so the deploy trigger is Hateem's Workers Builds import (guided).
- **Note — deploy branch:** all Phase 0 code is on `claude/phase-0-kickoff-ou58xh` (PR #1, not yet merged to main). Recommend pointing Workers Builds at that branch for now to get the live preview during Phase 0; switch the production branch to `main` when PR #1 merges at the Phase 0 sign-off.
- **Next:** Hateem sets up Workers Builds (import repo + build command + PAYLOAD_SECRET) → first deploy to workers.dev (gate item 1) → create first admin at `/admin` → then full §15 smoke test through Payload.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 1 (cont.) · Phase 0 plan APPROVED; execution begun

**What was done**
- Hateem approved the Phase 0 execution plan and answered the four plan-shaping decisions (all recorded in `DECISIONS.md`):
  1. **CF1 / Email Routing → NOT used.** Hostinger already runs catch-all on **both** wear-run.com and wear-run.help, forwarding everything (incl. `partner@`) to `hateem@wear-run.com`. Cloudflare Email Routing would seize MX and break this → **plan chunk E5 dropped.** The SPF-merge safeguard now applies between Hostinger's and Resend's SPF on wear-run.com (chunk E2).
  2. **Cloudflare access → scoped API token** (Claude runs D1/R2/DNS automation).
  3. **Deploy → Cloudflare Workers Builds** (GitHub Actions reserved for backups).
  4. **Admin lock → Cloudflare Access on `/admin` ENABLED.**
- Approved plan saved at `/root/.claude/plans/session-1-phase-vivid-falcon.md` (machine-local; the authoritative copy of the chunked A–G plan).

**Scaffold DONE (chunks B1 + B2) — commit "feat: scaffold Payload CMS on Cloudflare (D1 + R2)…"**
- Brought in the official Payload `with-cloudflare-d1` template as the foundation; verified **`pnpm install` clean and `pnpm build` green** (compile + full TypeScript type-check + static generation) on this Node 22 container.
- **Version decisions applied (spec §0.4 = latest-stable-within-locked-major; recorded here as internal engineering, CLAUDE.md §6):**
  - `next` **16.2.10** — spec §2 locks Next 16.2.x; the official template unexpectedly shipped **15.4.11** (its own `eslint-config-next` was already 16.2.7). Aligned up to the locked major and verified the build. `@opennextjs/cloudflare` → **1.20.1** for Next 16 support.
  - Payload stack (`payload`, `@payloadcms/db-d1-sqlite`, `/next`, `/richtext-lexical`, `/storage-r2`, `/ui`) → **3.86.0** (latest 3.x; template shipped 3.82.1). Spec §2 also mandates pinning the latest D1 adapter → 3.86.0.
  - `typescript` **6.0.3** kept (the template's tested version; stable, pre-TS-7). **This supersedes my earlier Session-1 suggestion to pin 5.9.3** — the template's tested toolchain is the better-informed choice; TS 7.0.2 remains a new-major ask.
  - `react`/`react-dom` 19.2.1, `wrangler` ~4.61.1 left at template versions (within spec majors).
- **Template rough edges fixed** (the "not working out of the box" issue #14041 territory), all internal engineering:
  - `build` script used a non-existent `payload build` subcommand → changed to `next build` (canonical Payload 3).
  - Added `src/types/payload-css.d.ts` declaring the untyped `@payloadcms/next/css` side-effect import so `tsc` passes.
  - Moved the R2 storage adapter from an invalid top-level `storage:` key into `plugins:` (Payload 3 API).
  - Named resources: worker `run-apparel`, D1 `run-apparel-db`, R2 `run-assets`; `database_id` left as placeholder until chunk C1 creates the DB.
  - Set D1 `remote: false` so local/CI builds need no Cloudflare credentials; the deployed Worker binds real D1 natively at runtime (revisit at Stage D deploy).
- **Node note:** container runs Node 22.22.2; the template's `engines` want ≥24.15 (pnpm warns, build works). Cloudflare Workers Builds uses its own Node at deploy time, so this is local-only.

**Next — blocked on Hateem's dashboard actions before the Cloudflare/deploy chunks (C–G) can run:** A1 (confirm Workers Paid Active), **A2 (create scoped API token + add `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` to this environment — the critical unblocker)**, A3 (domain DNS onto Cloudflare, preserving Hostinger mail records), plus the 5-item readiness yes/no checklist (Workers Paid, card on file, DNS access ×2, Hostinger access). Once the token lands: chunks C (create D1/R2) → D (Workers Builds + first deploy) → G (backup + §15 smoke test) run as a clean pass.

**Email-architecture note (spec §11 deviation, logged):** wear-run.com now *receives* inbound mail via Hostinger catch-all (→ hateem@), beyond the spec's "robots-only .com" design. Compatible with Resend sending once SPF is merged; flagged for Hateem to confirm as intentional.

## 2026-07-12 — Session 1 · Phase 0 kickoff: filing, orientation, readiness check, plan

**What was done**
- Filed the constitution v1 at the repo root and committed it ("chore: add project constitution v1"): `CLAUDE.md`, `RUN_APPAREL_Website_Build_Master_Prompt.md` (v1.1), `RUN_APPAREL_Master_Prompt.md`, `RUN_APPAREL_RFQ_SYSTEM_MASTER_PLAN_JULY_2026_UPDATED.md` (v2.0 reconstructed). All four verified byte-identical to Hateem's uploads (checksums matched). These files are read-only to Claude (spec §0.1; CLAUDE.md §2).
- Created `BUILD_LOG.md` (this file) and `DECISIONS.md` per CLAUDE.md §4.
- Read all three constitution documents in full; produced the plain-language readback, the verify-and-pin version snapshot, and the chunked Phase 0 plan (delivered in the session report / PR description).
- Live readiness check from the build machine:
  - Git remote access to `hateem2121/website`: ✅ works (clone, commit, push).
  - `wrangler whoami` (wrangler 4.110.0): ❌ **not authenticated** — this remote build container has no Cloudflare credentials. Expected at this stage; Cloudflare account, Workers Paid status, and login must be confirmed by Hateem / at execution time. **Workers Paid = NOT yet verified.**
  - Not verifiable from here (asked Hateem as a yes/no checklist): DNS access at both registrars, Hostinger admin access, card on file with Cloudflare.
- Version snapshot taken from the npm registry (2026-07-12), all within the spec §2 locked majors — intended pins, applied only when scaffolding is approved: next 16.2.10 · react/react-dom 19.2.7 · typescript 5.9.3 (see open question on TS 7) · payload 3.86.0 · @payloadcms/db-d1-sqlite 3.86.0 · @payloadcms/next 3.86.0 · @payloadcms/richtext-lexical 3.86.0 · tailwindcss 4.3.2 · @opennextjs/cloudflare 1.20.1 · wrangler 4.110.0 · @react-three/fiber 9.6.1 · @react-three/drei 10.7.7 · three 0.185.1 · motion 12.42.2 · gsap 3.15.0 · @gltf-transform/cli 4.4.1 · zod 4.4.3 · resend 6.17.2.
- Recorded as fact (spec §2 constraint set): Cloudflare Image Transformations free allowance = 5,000 unique transformations/month with a **hard stop** beyond it (no surprise billing); image strategy must fit inside this or pre-generate sizes.
- **Nothing was scaffolded or deployed. No Cloudflare / DNS / Hostinger / GitHub-settings state was changed.** Work delivered on branch `claude/phase-0-kickoff-ou58xh` via draft PR (see open question on CLAUDE.md §8 "one branch: main").

**In progress**
- Waiting on Hateem: (1) approval of the Phase 0 plan; (2) CF1 answer (A/B) for `DECISIONS.md`; (3) readiness yes/no checklist (Workers Paid active · card on file · DNS access wear-run.com · DNS access wear-run.help · Hostinger admin); (4) deploy-mechanism choice (Workers Builds vs GitHub Actions); (5) TypeScript pin confirmation (5.9.3 recommended vs 7.0.2).

**Open (non-blocking) questions**
- CLAUDE.md §2 says the three spec documents live in `docs/spec/`; the Session-1 instruction said repo root, exactly as named. Filed at repo root per the instruction; proposed CLAUDE.md amendment (path correction) awaiting Hateem — needs his approval since CLAUDE.md is read-only to Claude.
- CLAUDE.md §8 says "one branch: main", but this remote build environment requires work on a designated session branch merged to `main` via pull request. Flagged for Hateem; suggest treating PR-to-main as the working convention for remote sessions.
- RFQ Plan v2.0 is a reconstruction: its §16 register (fabric/fibre library, size lists, branding options, copy C1–C9 + email subject, 5-second minimum-fill-time, currency-map examples) still needs Hateem's line-by-line approval. Not needed for Phase 0; needed before Phase 2 (fabricLibrary seed) and Phase 5 (RFQ copy).
- CLAUDE.md footer and RFQ Plan footer both carry "approved by Hateem on [date]" placeholders — dates to be filled when Hateem confirms (an edit only he can authorize).
- TypeScript 7.0.2 is now `latest` on npm (new Go-based major, released ~this month). Recommendation: pin 5.9.3 (mature line the whole ecosystem targets); TS 7 adoption is a new-major ask per spec §0.4.
- Spec §2 names Tailwind "v4.1.x"; current stable within major 4 is 4.3.2. Intent per spec §0.4 is latest-stable-within-major, so 4.3.2 is the intended pin — flagged for transparency.

**Next step**
- On Hateem's approval of the plan (and answers to the blocking questions): execute Phase 0 chunk by chunk, starting with C1 (scaffold from the official Payload `with-cloudflare-d1` template) after Hateem completes H1 (Workers Paid confirmation). Run the spec §15 smoke test after first deploy; log results here and in the runbook.
